# Computer

- Load the `computer_*` tools with `tool_search`, one group per query: `computer open window`, `computer wait browser`, `computer files clipboard record`, `computer click hover drag scroll`, `computer type press select timeline`, `computer view viewport`.
- The `/computer-*` commands belong to the user: when a refusal names one, ask the user to run it.

## Addresses

- A machine starts on its first use. An address belongs to the machine or sandbox that issued it, and every call on it runs there; nothing falls back to this machine.
- Short forms are `computer:<machine>/<letter><number><tag>`: `w` window, `o` observation, `s` sequence, `a` app, `b` sandbox, `d` display. The tag changes every Pi run, so an address from an earlier run refuses.

## Look

- A sandbox address takes the same `/windows` and `/apps` searches as a machine. Discovery launches nothing.
- {search} an observation to filter its lines without a new capture.
- An overview is 1280 px on the long edge by default.
- `offset` and `limit` page an observation's stored text without capturing again.
- A UI walk cut by limits or time leaves missing elements unknown, not absent.
- OCR can be wrong. For small text, use a viewport or `capture:{"granularity":"image","maxLongEdge":3840}`.

## Input

- Input spends the window's native refs; its change list brings the new ones.
- On native windows, a ref or locator goes through UI Automation in the background, without the human's pointer or focus. When the app does not react to it, use a point instead.
- Drags, `computer_hover` and `computer_timeline` are real input: the window comes to the front. `computer_select` and menus run through UI Automation.
- While the human uses the keyboard or mouse, real input refuses for the time the refusal gives. Wait; never race the human.

Native locators run over the UI Automation tree:

- `getByRole` — UIA control types as ARIA roles: `Button` → `button`, `Edit` → `textbox`, `ListItem` → `listitem` and `option`.
- `getByText`, `getByLabel`, `getByTitle` — visible text, a control's label, UIA help text.
- `getByTestId` — UIA AutomationId.
- `.filter()`, `.nth()`, `.first()`, `.last()`, `.and()`, `.or()` and chaining work as in Playwright. CSS and XPath refuse.

## Waits and viewports

- After `computer_wait`, the last sample's refs are current.
- The change list after input on a viewport covers only the viewport.
- {read} of a viewport only looks: the window's latest observation and refs stay current.
- {delete} removes a viewport; it also goes away with its window.
- Maximize an app that resizes its own window before making viewports.

## Displays

- Pick a resolution with the display's aspect ratio: a 3840×2560 display has no 1920×1280, and 2160×1440 is its closest smaller mode.
- The human sees the new resolution too: tell the user it stays until the computer session closes. Earlier display and window observations stop working; {read} again.

## Browser pages

- Keys go to the page, so browser shortcuts such as `alt+ArrowLeft` do not run there: use `computer_browser`, or `space: "window"`.
- A popup does not become the active tab by itself: `computer_browser` `switch_tab`.
- Downloads land in a temporary folder that closing the session deletes; copy what you need.
- Providers such as Google can reject an automated browser even with `profile: "agent"`.
- Closing the session detaches an attached browser and leaves it open.

`computer_open` at a window address attaches by one of these routes:

- debugging endpoint — a browser, Electron or CEF app started with `--remote-debugging-port=0` in `args`, or a WebView2 app with debugging on. Chrome and Edge need their own `--user-data-dir` for this; Edge also `--disable-sync`.
- remote debugging turned on at `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` or `edge://inspect/#remote-debugging` — the browser asks "Allow remote debugging?" and waits up to 2 minutes; the user, or the agent in another call, clicks Allow.
- Playwright Extension — installed by the user; attaching waits up to 2 minutes for "Allow & select".
- VS Code's integrated browser — through `/computer-setup vscode-bridge` and a full VS Code restart.

## Work apart from the human's desktop

- Windows Sandbox — its own focus, pointer, windows and clipboard; starts in 15–20 s; one at a time per machine, and the human's Windows session must be active. The guest has no Notepad.
- Isolated session — invisible to the human; starts in 15–25 s; several can run at once. Its desktop is 640×480, some apps are missing by name (start them by `path`) and no files are shared.
- Neither is a security boundary. Their addresses work like a machine's.
- Another machine acts only there: a `url` such as `127.0.0.1` means that machine. Its Windows session must be active, or screenshots come back white.

## Files and recording

- Save app documents in the session folder of `computer_files`, not in the user's folders.
- An app with its own scripting can build content: `computer_files` `put` the script, `computer_open` the app with its path in `args`, then {read} the window.
- The clipboard is shared with the user's apps.
- A window `sequence` spends the window's refs: {read} it again before input. A `watch` keeps them.
- While a `watch` runs, each action's receipt names its frames, and `frames:last` shows the newest one.

## Receipts in Codemode

Every `computer_*` tool resolves to a receipt object, also when it refused or its outcome is unknown, so a script branches without try/catch:

- `outcome` — `delivered` (not proof the app responded), `refused` (nothing was sent), `unknown` (may have reached the target: {read} again, never replay), `observed` or `closed`.
- `effect` — `applied`, `not-applied` or `unknown`.
- `stage` — `validation` when the request was rejected before reaching the target, otherwise `target`.
- `window`, `viewport`, `observation`, `sandbox` — the addresses the call used or issued.
- `reason`, `code` — why a refused or unknown action ended.
- `page`, `evaluation`, `verification`, `changes`, `steps`, `watch_spans` — when the action produced them.
- `text` — the receipt the model sees.

Check `outcome` before the next input: after a refused click, keys go to whatever has focus. A script that clicks many points uses a viewport: an action's change-list image can have another size than the last {read}. `store()` of a script that later fails is lost.

## Cleanup

Close only windows the task opened.
